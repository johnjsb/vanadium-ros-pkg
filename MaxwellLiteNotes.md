# Assembly Notes #
  1. Prepare the layout by taping the 4 sheets together -- be careful to line up the screw holes.
  1. Drilling the base requires the following drill size: 1/8", 1/4", 1", and either 1-3/8" or 1-1/2". For the larger 1" and 1-1/2" holes, we recommend using a Forstner bit -- Home Depot sells a Ryobi 8-pc set of Forstner bits which includes the 1" and 1-3/8" size.
  1. Assemble the standoffs to the battery and column holders and base using 3/4" long 1/4-20 screws (QTY 16).
