# Introduction #

This repository is home to a number of software packages for interacting with ROS-based robots powered by products and technologies from Vanadium Labs. Most packages are documented on the [ROS.org](http://www.ros.org) wiki, however this wiki contains documentation of hardware specifications as well as items that are in early beta.

# Mini Max #
Mini Max is a miniature version of Maxwell, a human-scale mobile manipulator developed here in our lab. Mini is aimed at hobby and educational uses, designed to be low-cost yet highly robust. Please see MiniMaxNotes for more details.
